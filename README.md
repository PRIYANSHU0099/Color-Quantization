# Color Quantization

This project implements **color quantization** using the **K-means clustering** algorithm. Color quantization is the process of reducing the number of distinct colors in an image while preserving its visual appearance as much as possible. This technique is commonly used in image compression and optimization.

## Overview

In this implementation, the **K-means clustering algorithm** is employed to group similar colors in an image and replace them with the cluster centroids, effectively reducing the number of colors. The result is a compressed image with fewer colors, which maintains the overall appearance of the original image while being more efficient in terms of storage and processing.

## Features

- **Color Quantization:** Reduces the number of distinct colors in an image.
- **K-means Clustering:** Utilizes the K-means algorithm to cluster colors and optimize the quantization process.
- **Image Compression:** Can be used to reduce file size while maintaining visual quality.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualizing results)


This color quantization project efficiently reduces the number of colors in an image using K-means clustering. It is useful for image compression tasks while ensuring minimal loss in visual quality.
